The solution is simple: remove any extra spaces between the operator and operands in the `calc()` function. For instance, instead of:

```css
width: calc(100% - 10 px);
```

Use:

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
```
By removing these spaces, the `calc()` function will correctly evaluate the expression.
