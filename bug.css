The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there is a potential bug where the calculation result might be unexpected if there is a space between the operator and operands. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10 px)` will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.
